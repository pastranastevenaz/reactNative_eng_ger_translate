# Android English to German Translator
This is a simple React native application which I've used
To build an Android application to help translate English
to German.

This is the codebase for said project, and will be improved over time.

### Built With
* node v4.2.6
* npm v3.5.2
* react-native-cli v1.2.0
* react-native v0.38.0

###### Additional NPM Packages
_beyond basic project packages and dependencies_
* [react-native-extended-stylesheet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-extended-stylesheet)  
* [react-native-button](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-button)

### Future Add-ons
As with most projects, this can still use some work.
I would like to continue to develop this a bit and add the
following to the projects

* A navigation drawer or other way to navigate to different options
* German to English translation
* Improve the color Scheme
* If possible, implement Google's voice API
